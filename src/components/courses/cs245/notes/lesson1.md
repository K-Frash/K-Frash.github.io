# Course Description
This course dives into the fundamentals of logic as a tool for representation, reasoning, and computation. Topics include:
* Propositional and predicate logic
* Formalizing the notions of correct and incorrect reasoning
* Defining what is computable, and exploring the limits of computation
* Godel's Incompleteness Theorem
* Applications of logic to computer science

CS 245 plays a key role in the development of mathematical skills required in the Computer Science program, and thus complements MATH 135 (Algebra), MATH 239 (Graph Theory and Enumeration), and STAT 230 (Probability). The course covers a variety of topics related to "logic and computation" that are required as background for other courses in Computer Science. It differs both in tone and content from a "logic" course one would typically find in a mathematics program. The course aims to:
* develop mathematical reasoning skills;
* improve understanding of propositional and first-order logic, including key notions, such as: expressing natural language statements as logical formulas, distinguishing between correct and incorrect reasoning (between valid and invalid logical arguments), constructing a formal proof, distinguishing between syntax and semantics; and
* explore the limits of computers, including computability and uncomputability.


## Learning Outcomes
At the end of the course, students should be able to:

* formalize English sentences into syntactically correct formulas in propositional logic and first-order logic and, conversely, interpret such formulas in English;
* formalize the notion of correct reasoning and proof, and be able to construct formal proofs;
* realize the limitation of formal proof systems; and
* understand applications of logic to computer science
